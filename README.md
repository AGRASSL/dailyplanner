# Daily Workday Planner Using 3rd Party APIs

This project was created with the purpose to learn, practice and properly exicute 3rd party APIs including jquery, bootstrap, and moment. Using these 3rd parties made constructing the progam a much more fluid and simple process as well as giving the application the ablility to adjust and change based on the given time. The planner displays a 9:00am-5:00pm work schedule with time slots in insert activites. When the user presses save in their activity, and they refresh the page, the input will save (with the use of local storage) keeping all activites intact. If the time of day is 10:00am for example, the 9:00am slot will turn grey showing that on that day, the time of 9:00-9:59am has passed. The current hour of 10:00-10:59am will appear a red color to show present, and all future slots will be green. The color code chart at the top of the page also shows the corresponding colors to times. 

# Technologies 

This project utilized HTML, CSS, and Javascript languages and the 3rd party APIs of jquery, moment, and bootstrap. The project largly focused on local storage and 3rd party APIs in order for everything to work properly.

# Implementation
